# Password Generator

## Description

This is a password generator, that was created with javascript, that allows you to create a randomized password through prompts. I built this starting off with starter code that provided me with HTML, CSS and script file. I wanted to test my abilities within javascript. 

While working on this project, a huge thing that I learned that I will be taking with me into future projects is; the ability to define functions, then to call onto that function whenever I need to. Being able to call a function that I designate will allow me to create cleaner code that is easier to read.

## Usage

In order to use the password generator first go to the webpage. Once you're at the webpage then click on the red "Generate Password" button as shown in (assets/images/Web-Page.png). Once you do that you will be prompted to input a number between 8-128 and afterwards you will see 4 more prompts that will ask you what you want your password to consist of, answer those to your personal preference and the javascript will do the rest! Your password will appear in the box with dotted lines.
